# IntroToDataAnalysis

This is a repository to upload code commits related to assignments in UMBC's Intro to Data Analysis & Machine Learning course.

As a precursor, I uploaded a few sample files and jupyter notebooks for current work deliverables & prior classwork to get familiar with GitHub and created a subfolder to publish assignments as the course progresses

Enjoy!
