# Assignment 1: Regression

## Deliverables:
This assignment contains 4 primary areas:

1. ReadMe file (This file): Providing a brief overview of the assignment's navigation, directions, contributors, and lanugages/tools/libraries used.

2. <a href=https://github.com/Lwhieldon/IntroToDataAnalysis/blob/master/Assignments/Assignment%201/Assignment_1.ipynb>Summary and Report</a>: Jupyter Notebook including a detailed abstract on problems in assignment, code relevant to project, and visualizations supporting the completion of the project.

3. <a href=https://github.com/Lwhieldon/IntroToDataAnalysis/blob/master/Assignments/Assignment%201/Sample%20-%20Superstore.csv>Dataset Used for Assignment:</a>. This data contains ~10k records and 17 columns.

4. <a href=https://github.com/Lwhieldon/IntroToDataAnalysis/blob/master/Assignments/Assignment%201/Code.ipynb>Code:</a> Area to perform testing of dataset, functions, and implement models before final project output (step 2). 

## Directions:

This assignment explore the application of a linear regression model to a dataset of my choosing. The below are required to successfully complete the assignment:

1. You cannot work with datasets that is explored in our textbooks or in our classes.

2. The Dataset should contain more than 200 observations (rows) and more than 4 columns.

3. Data can be relatively clean but you should be doing the preprocessing procedures on your own.

4. As it is explained in <b>Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (2nd edition) chapter-2</b>, you should be able to explain the business goal of your project very clearly.

5. If you are applying a transformation to some of your features you should explain the rationale of such decisions.

6. You should use visualization techniques to explore the data and to support your results.

7. You should be able to assess the model fitness and you should do model diagnosis as it is described in ISLR 3.3.3.
