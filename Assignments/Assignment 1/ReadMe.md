## The first homework details
This first homework is due to week-4 lecture <b>(09/22/2020)</b>.
This assignment explore the application of a linear regression model to a dataset of my choosing.

# Directions:
Professor has detailed specifics related to criterion for the successful completion of this assignment:

1. You cannot work with datasets that is explored in our textbooks or in our classes.

2. The Dataset should contain more than 200 observations (rows) and more than 4 columns.

3. Data can be relatively clean but you should be doing the preprocessing procedures on your own.

4. As it is explained in <b>Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow (2nd edition) chapter-2</b>, you should be able to explain the business goal of your project very clearly.

5. If you are applying a transformation to some of your features you should explain the rationale of such decisions.

6. You should use visualization techniques to explore the data and to support your results.

7. You should be able to assess the model fitness and you should do model diagnosis as it is described in ISLR 3.3.3.

## Deliverables:
This assignment contains 2 primary areas:

1. ReadMe file (This file)

2. Code, Summary, and Report within Jupyter Notebook: <a href=https://github.com/Lwhieldon/IntroToDataAnalysis/blob/master/Assignments/Assignment%201/Assignment_1.ipynb>Link to Notebook</a>
