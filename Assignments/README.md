# IntroToDataAnalysis

This is a repository to upload code commits related to assignments in UMBC's Intro to Data Analysis & Machine Learning course.

As a precursor, I uploaded a sample index.html as well as web scraping jupyter notebook to gather data from different newspapers that I use as the underlying source for a Tableau Public COVID Dashboard.

Enjoy!
